## üîê **Cryptographic Security Considerations**

### Universal Strengths

1. **BIP32/BIP44 Compliance**: All implementations follow proven standards with appropriate hardened derivation levels
2. **Entropy Security**: All use BIP39 with 128/256 bits of entropy for seed generation
3. **Key Isolation**: Each network uses independent derivation paths preventing key reuse
4. **Hardware Wallet Compatible**: All implementations work with major hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor, Keystone)
5. **Gap Limit Compliance**: Proper address discovery patterns for wallet recovery

### Future Considerations

#### Quantum Resistance Analysis
- **Ed25519 (Cardano/Solana)**: More resistant to quantum attacks
- **secp256k1 (Bitcoin/Ethereum/Others)**: Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm but still secure for foreseeable future

#### Standards Adherence
- All implementations follow established standards ensuring interoperability
- Proper hardened derivation prevents key leakage between levels
- Compatible with industry recovery tools and wallet imports
